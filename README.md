# VBA Scripting

Please refer to 'Module_2_Challenge.bas' to view the VBA script

**Background**
I have used VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.

**Instructions**
Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
The ticker symbol
Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

**What I've done**
I added functionality to my script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase," "Greatest % decrease," and "Greatest total volume." I made the necessary adjustments to my VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once. I ensured that the conditional formatting highlighted positive change in green and negative change in red.

During the development of my code, I used the sheet "alphabetical_testing.xlsx" for testing purposes. This dataset was smaller and allowed for faster testing. My code successfully ran on this file within 3 to 5 minutes.

I made sure that the script acted consistently on every sheet. The beauty of VBA is that it eliminates the tedium of repetitive tasks with just a click of a button.
